"""desk-robot brain server.

Run with:  python -m brain.main   (from the server/ directory, venv active)

Three jobs:
  1. WebSocket server the robot connects to over WiFi.
  2. An interactive console so you can talk to the brain and puppet the
     robot from your keyboard right now.
  3. Listening: hears "hey Rocky" on the mic, sends what you say to
     the language model, and speaks the reply through the robot (or the Mac).

A reply is a pipeline, not a wait: the model's words stream in, each
finished sentence goes to the voice as soon as it exists, and the voice's
audio streams to the speaker as it's made. If you start talking again
before Rocky has begun speaking, the reply is dropped and he listens to
the rest of what you're saying, then answers once.

Console commands:
  ask <question>   send a question to the brain, print and speak the reply
  say <text>       speak text (robot speaker if connected, else the Mac)
  volume <0-1>     set the robot's speaker volume
  track on|off     face tracking (head follows you)
  listen           toggle listening on the microphone
  mic              3-second level meter to check the microphone
  emo <name>       push a face to the connected robot
  pan <deg>        push a head turn to the connected robot
  tilt <deg>       push a head nod to the connected robot
  status           show whether a robot is connected
  quit
