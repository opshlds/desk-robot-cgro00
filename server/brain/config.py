#   REPLY_MAX_SENTENCES
#                 the prompt asks for at most this many, and the server cuts

#                 can't reproduce bass; it just rattles the shell. A deep
#                 voice wants 250-350.
#   TTS_PRESENCE_DB
#                 boost above ~1.5 kHz, where speech clarity lives, 0 = off.
#                 Lifts a muffled voice; too much sounds thin and hissy.
# The console page has sliders for level / bass cut / presence that apply
# live; set the winners here to keep them.
